# Times of Tech

A cross-platform (Android/IOS) mobile application built with React Native and Expo to allow users to read stories from Hacker News directly from their phones, with a better UI. 

## Features
- Allows users to easily filter stories by categories like ShowHN and AskHN or just browse through all the stories (Best, New, Top). 
- Each story can be read within the app and has an option to be read out loud to you if you provide your own ElevenLabs API key. 
- The comment thread for each story can be viewed, and if the story leads to an external article link, you can view this without leaving the app.
